Irrduino is an Arduino-based irrigation control system.

THIS PROJECT HAS MOVED TO GITHUB:
https://github.com/google/irrduino

In preparation for the planned [shutdown of Google Code](http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html), we have moved this project to GitHub. We expect irrduino to live a long and happy life in its new host service.
